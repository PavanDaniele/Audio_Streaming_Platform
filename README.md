# Audio_Streaming_Platform

##Project Description

The project is based on creating a web application that provides a digital music service similar to the more famous 'Spotify' platform.
The web application, called 'Unify', interfaces with an underlying SQL database designed specifically for this purpose and integrated using libraries from Flask and SQLAlchemy in the Python language.
PostgreSQL was chosen as the DBMS, and pgadmin was chosen to communicate with the database.
